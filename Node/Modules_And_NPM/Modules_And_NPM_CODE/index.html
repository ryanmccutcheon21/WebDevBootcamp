Notice how blue.js, janet.js, and sadie.js export their objects.
Then the index.js requires them, (basically imports them).
Then it puts them all into an array saved into the variable allCats.
Then it exports them so they can be used elsewhere.

Then notice how app.js imports the shelter directory with require, which was just created.
Saves it to the variable cats.
Then it console.log the directory to show that the files were exported.
