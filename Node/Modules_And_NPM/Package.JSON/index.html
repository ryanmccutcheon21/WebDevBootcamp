What is it?

- contains meta data about the particular project,
or package, or application.

- goes in every node app we create



Creating Our Own package.json

- Go to terminal in project you want to create the package in

- Type npm init

- This is the easiest way to create a package.json
that comforms to the template that we follow

- Enter information you want into what comes up
after running npm init

- This will make a package.json with the information
you provided.



Installing a Package to Our package.json We Created

- He installs figlet from npm into the Artser directory

- See the Artser file

- to install it he typed npm i figlet

- this is used in case the node_modules gets deleted
or if you want to send the project to someone else, so
they can see what dependencies you installed from npm

- Got it to work on myArtster

- cd into myArtster and then type node index.js
to get it to run in the terminal





Installing All Dependencies for a Project:

- Nice for other people if they are ever going
to be working on the code

- We normally don't include the node_modules
when we share code with people

- Why you won't see node_modules in github repos

- you will see the package.json

- Go to Make Group Chat App bookmark and download the
zip file and add it to a directory

- I added it to MyGroupChatApp

- Notice it doesn't come with node_modules

- If you try to run node index.js in the terminal
you will get an error right now because it is expecting
module called 'express'

- you can go into the package.json file to see what
depencies were installed to make the app

- instead of having to install all the dependencies
individually, if you go to the terminal in the directory still,
and type

npm install

with nothing after it, it will install all the
dependencies.

- now if you type node index.js in the terminal
it will say: listening on *:8080

- so open a new window and enter:
localhost:8080
