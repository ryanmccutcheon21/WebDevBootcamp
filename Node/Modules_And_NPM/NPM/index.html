What is it?

- A library of thousands of packages published
by other developers that we can use for free!

- A command line tool to easily install and manage
those packages in our Node projects.




Can be used to do a bunch of stuff:

- See NPM Give Me A Joke and NPM Colors on bookmarks in Chrome.




To install NPM:

- Go to Terminal

- Type npm install packageNameFromNPMWEbsite

- Want to run the command and install in the directory you
want the npm to be installed to.





Working With NPM:

- See the Jokester file

- He installed Give Me A Joke from npm

- Then required it in the index.js to import it

- Then he console.dir(joke);

- He got an object with different methods to get a joke

- He used the getRandomDadJoke method in the index.js

-The method is callback based. You can tell
because the returned object looks like this:

getRandomDadJoke: [Function]


- That is why he used a function to log the joke.

- To see the result:
1. Go to the Jokester Directory in Terminal by cd'ing into it
2. Then type node index.js
3. Should return a joke with rainbow letters because
of the .rainbow used which is another NPM package he used.




Adding Global Packages:

- Usually want to install npm to specific directory
we want to use it in.
- Helps for when there are updates to npm
- Sometimes might want to install globally, if it is suggested
in the installation of the npm node
