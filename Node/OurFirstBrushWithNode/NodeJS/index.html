- NodeJS is used to use JS on the server-side. We can run
JS code without a browsers.


What is NodeJS Used For?

- Web Servers
- Command Line Tools
- Native Apps (VS Code is built with Node!)
- Video Games
- Drone Software
- And More!



The Node REPL:

- Read Evaluate Print Loop
- Typically used to debug, test, play around w/ new features.

- After typing ' node ' in the terminal, now we can type JS code.
Just like the chrome dev tools but in the terminal. Typing node in
the terminal takes us into the node REPL.
- Can't user browser functions like document. or window.



Running Node Files:

- Go to terminal
- Find firstScript.js in web-dev-bootcamp
- cd into Node_Intro_CODE
- type in node firstScript.js
- this will run the script code in the terminal




Process & Argv:

- The process.argv property returns an array containing
the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process
was launched. The first element will be process.execPath.
See process.argv0 if access to the original value of argv[0]
is needed. The second element will be the path to the JavaScript
file being executed. The remaining elements will be any
additional command-line arguments.
