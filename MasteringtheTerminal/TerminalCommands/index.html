LS:

Stands for List.

It lists the current contents of the directory you are in
at the moment.




PWD:

Print Working directory

Will tell you where you currently are.





Changing Directories "CD":

Type

cd directoryName

to go to that directory.


cd ..

is how you can backup one directory.




Relative vs Absolute Paths:

cd /Users/ryanmccutcheon

can use this anywhere and by telling it exactly where
you want to go it will take you there. It is an Absolute Path.



cd /

takes you to the root directory because the slash /
is known as a root.




cd ~

will take you straight to the home directory (where you usually start
when opening terminal)





cd ../../directoryName


This is a relative path. Says go back two levels, then go into the
directory you specified.



MKDIR = Make Directory:

Type

mkdir directoryName anotherDirectory

And that will make a folder inside the directory
you are currently in.

To add multiple directories, just add a space between
the names of the directories as in the example.



Man & Flag:

man ls

will give you information about ls

It shows different flags you can use.


type:

q

to get out of the man directory




The Touch Command:

touch fileName

will make a file with that name and extension for us.






Remove Files & Folders:

rm fileYouWantToRemove

Doesn't send it to the trash, it just deletes entirely.
So be careful.




rmdir directoryName

Only deletes empty folders/directories



rm -rf directoryName

Deletes the directory/folder even if it has stuff in it.
